# Q13. Table 'Order' is used the most.
# WHY? I searched for 'FROM' on the whole script,
# then count each used table manually and compare.
# EXPLANATION: It has many FKs, each refers to a key-table,
# such as Employees, Customers, OrderDetails (& Orders, indirectly)

# Q14. The database is in Third Normal Form
# 1. All tables are in 2NF
# 2. All non-key attributes are directly depended key => 3NF
# 3. Non-key PostalCode infers Country, City, Region (table Employees). => Violates BCNF
